# q2-boots ðŸ¥¾

![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/caporaso-lab/q2-boots)

q2-boots is a [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org) plugin providing bootstrapped and rarefaction-based (collectively, resampled) alpha and beta diversity analyses, designed to mirror the interface of q2-diversity.

```{admonition} Development status
:class: tip
q2-boots is in beta release. It is sufficiently validated and ready for real-world data analysis, but **interfaces are still subject to change**. For example, default parameter settings, command names, and outputs generated by specific commands may evolve as we get usability feedback and feature requests from users.
```

## Installation

### Install Prerequisites

{{ miniconda_url }} provides the `conda` environment and package manager, and is currently the only supported way to install QIIME 2.
Follow the instructions for downloading and installing Miniconda.

After installing Miniconda and opening a new terminal, make sure you're running the latest version of `conda`.

```bash
conda update conda
```

### QIIME 2024.10 development version of q2-boots

Installing the most recent development version of q2-boots allows you to access the most recent functionality, including some that depends on features being introduced in QIIME 2 2024.10.

```shell
conda env create -n q2-boots-2024.10 -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiime2/q2-boots/main/environments/q2-boots-qiime2-amplicon-2024.10.yml
```

```shell
conda activate q2-boots-2024.10
```

## Using `q2-boots`

After completing the install steps above, you can review the top-level q2-boots help text by running:

```shell
qiime boots --help
```

To view the help text for a specific command, including executable usage examples, you can run:

```shell
qiime boots core-metrics --help
```

This will display the help text for the `core-metrics` command.
Calling `core-metrics` with the `--example-data` parameter will write example data to the directory of your choosing.
For example:

```shell
qiime boots core-metrics --example-data cm-example-data
```

will write example input data to a new `cm-example-data` directory.
That directory will contain a sub-directory per usage example:

```shell
cm-example-data
â”œâ”€â”€ Bootstrapped core metrics.
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.tsv
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ table.qza
â””â”€â”€ Rarefaction-based core metrics.
    â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.tsv
    â””â”€â”€ table.qza
```

Notice that the subdirectory names align with names of the usage examples in the core-metrics `--help` text.
Change into one of those directories and run the corresponding usage example to test out the command.
You can then adapt the usage example commands to apply to your own data.

Have fun! ðŸ˜Ž

## About

`q2-boots` was developed for a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science project at [Northern Arizona University (NAU)](https://www.nau.edu), and will be maintained by the [Caporaso Lab](https://cap-lab.bio) at NAU.

The `q2-boots` Python package was built using content from the [QIIME 2 plugin template](https://develop.qiime2.org/en/latest/plugins/tutorials/create-from-template.html).
To learn more about `q2-boots`, refer to the [project website](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/q2-boots).
To learn how to use QIIME 2, refer to the [QIIME 2 User Documentation](https://docs.qiime2.org).
To learn QIIME 2 plugin development, refer to [*Developing with QIIME 2*](https://develop.qiime2.org).

`q2-boots` is a QIIME 2 *community plugin*.
While this plugin is developed in the Caporaso Lab, community plugins in general are not necessarily developed and maintained by the developers of QIIME 2.
Because community plugins are developed by the QIIME 2 developer community, and not necessarily the QIIME 2 developers themselves, some may not be actively maintained or compatible with current release versions of the QIIME 2 distributions.
More information on development and support for community plugins can be found [here](https://library.qiime2.org).
